1. A breakpoint is where you select a line of code that you want to pause at when you run the program and it will launch the debugging console.
2. No it will launch the debugging console before it runs the breakpoint line.
3. We can use the step over function which allows us to step over the breakpoint line and go to the next line of code directly after where it will pause and wait
4. The step into function allows us to step into the code on the breakpoint line eg if its a method it will jump directly to that method and pause at the top of that method.
5. Evaluate expression allows us to run code and call methods on the instances/ object we have created. Evaluate code fragment allows us to run multiple lines of code and create temporary variables to store items.
